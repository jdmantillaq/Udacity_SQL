##  Subquery
We want to find the average number of events for each day for each channel.
The first table will provide us the number of events for each day and channel,
and then we will need to average these values together using a second query.

```sql
SELECT
	channel,
	round(
		avg(repetitions),
		2
	)
FROM
	(
		SELECT
			date_trunc(
				'day',
				we.occurred_at
			),
			we.channel channel,
			count(*) repetitions
		FROM
			web_events we
		GROUP BY
			1,
			2
	) t1
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	2 DESC
;
```
On which day-channel pair did the most events occur.
```sql
SELECT
	date_trunc(
		'day',
		we.occurred_at
	),
		we.channel channel,
		count(*) repetitions
FROM
	web_events we
GROUP BY
		1,
		2
ORDER BY
	3 DESC;
```
##  More on Subquery


```sql
SELECT
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		we.occurred_at
	)
FROM
	web_events we
ORDER BY
	1
LIMIT 1;
```

```sql
SELECT
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	avg(o.standard_qty) standard_qty,
	avg(o.poster_qty) poster_qty,
	avg(o.gloss_qty) gloss_qty,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total
FROM
	orders o
WHERE
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	) = (
		SELECT
			date_trunc(

## Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount OF
total_amt_usd sales.
