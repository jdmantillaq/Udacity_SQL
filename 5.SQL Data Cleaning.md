## LEFT & RIGHT


In the accounts table, there is a column holding the website for each company.
The last three digits specify what type of web address they are using.
A list of extensions (and pricing) is provided here(opens in a new tab).
Pull these extensions and provide how many of each website type exist IN
the accounts table.

```sql
SELECT RIGHT(a.website, 3) type_of_web, count(*)
FROM accounts a
GROUP BY
    1;
```

There is much debate about how much the name (or even the first letter OF
a company name) matters. Use the accounts table to pull
the first letter of each company name to see the distribution of company
names that begin with each letter (or number).
```sql
SELECT LEFT(a.name, 1) first_letter, count(*)
FROM accounts a
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY 1;
```

Use the accounts table and a CASE statement to create two groups: one
group of company names that start with a number and a second group OF
those company names that start with a letter. What proportion of company
names start with a letter?
```sql
WITH
    total AS (
        SELECT count(*)
        FROM accounts a
    )
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN left(a.name, 1) IN (
            '0',
            '1',
            '2',
            '3',
            '4',
            '5',
            '6',
            '7',
            '8',
            '9'
        ) THEN 'Number'
        ELSE 'Letter'
    END,
    count(*),
    count(*) * 100 / (
        SELECT *
        FROM total
    ) proportion
FROM accounts a
GROUP BY
    1;
```

Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u. What proportion of company names
start with a vowel, and what percent start with anything else?
```sql
WITH
    total AS (
        SELECT count(*)
        FROM accounts a
    )
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN lower(left(a.name, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') THEN 'vowel'
        ELSE 'else'
    END,
    count(*),
    count(*) * 100 / (
        SELECT *
        FROM total
    ) proportion
FROM accounts a
GROUP BY
    1;
```

##  POSITION & STRPOS


Use the accounts table to create first and last name columns that hold the
first and last names for the primary_poc.
```sql
SELECT left(
        a.primary_poc, strpos(a.primary_poc, ' ') -1
    ) first_name, right(
        a.primary_poc, length(a.primary_poc) - strpos(a.primary_poc, ' ')
    ) lastname
FROM accounts a;
```

Now see if you can do the same thing for every rep name in the sales_reps table.
Again provide first and last name columns.
```sql
SELECT left(
        sr.name, strpos(sr.name, ' ') -1
    ) first_name, right(
        sr.name, length(sr.name) - strpos(sr.name, ' ')
    ) lastname
FROM sales_reps sr;
```

##  POSITION & STRPOS


Each company in the accounts table wants to create an email address FOR
each primary_poc. The email address should be the first name of the
primary_poc . last name primary_poc @ company name .com.
```sql
WITH
    names_poc AS (
        SELECT
            a.id,
            LEFT(
                a.primary_poc,
                strpos(a.primary_poc, ' ') -1
            ) first_name,
            RIGHT(
                a.primary_poc,
                length(a.primary_poc) - strpos(a.primary_poc, ' ')
            ) last_name,
            substr(
                a.website,
                5,
                length(a.website) - 8
            ) company
        FROM accounts a
    )
SELECT a.*, concat(
        first_name, '.', last_name, '@', company, '.com'
    ) email
FROM names_poc
    JOIN accounts a ON names_poc.id = a.id;
```

You may have noticed that in the previous solution some of the company
names include spaces, which will certainly not work in an email address.
See if you can create an email address that will work by removing all OF
the spaces in the account name, but otherwise your solution should be just
as in question 1.

We would also like to create an initial password, which they will CHANGE
after their first log in. The first password will be the first letter OF
the primary_poc's first name (lowercase), then the last letter of their
first name (lowercase), the first letter of their last name (lowercase),
the last letter of their last name (lowercase), the number of letters in
their first name, the number of letters in their last name, and then the
name of the company they are working with, all capitalized with no spaces.
```sql
WITH
    names_poc AS (
        SELECT
            a.id,
            LEFT(
                a.primary_poc,
                strpos(a.primary_poc, ' ') -1
            ) first_name,
            RIGHT(
                a.primary_poc,
                length(a.primary_poc) - strpos(a.primary_poc, ' ')
            ) last_name,
            substr(
                a.website,
                5,
                length(a.website) - 8
            ) company
        FROM accounts a
    )
SELECT a.primary_poc, concat(
        first_name, '.', last_name, '@', company, '.com'
    ) email, lower(
        concat(
            left(first_name, 1), right(first_name, 1), left(last_name, 1), right(last_name, 1), length(first_name), length(last_name)
        )
    ) || upper(company) PASSWORD
FROM names_poc
    JOIN accounts a ON names_poc.id = a.id;
```

##  CAST
```sql
WITH
    d AS (
        SELECT date, substr(date, 7, 4) AS YEAR, substr(date, 4, 2) AS DAY, LEFT(date, 2) AS MONTH
        FROM sf_crime_data
        LIMIT 10
    ),
    d2 AS (
        SELECT YEAR || '-' || MONTH || '-' || DAY AS df
        FROM d
    )
SELECT CAST(df AS date)
