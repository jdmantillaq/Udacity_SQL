# SQL for Data Analysis â€“ Udacity Exercises

This repository contains solutions to the exercises from the [SQL for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198) course on Udacity. These exercises are designed to strengthen SQL skills for data analysis.

## Database

The database used in the exercises is located at `database/parch-and-posey.sql`.

To locally install the database, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. Open your terminal and create a new database:
    ```sh
    createdb parch_and_posey
    ```

3. Import the SQL file into the newly created database:
    ```sh
    psql -d parch_and_posey -f database/parch-and-posey.sql
    ```

4. Verify the database has been imported correctly by connecting to it:
    ```sh
    psql parch_and_posey
    ```

You should now have the `parch_and_posey` database set up and ready for use with the exercises.
