## JOIN

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;
```

Try pulling all the data from the accounts table, and all the data from the orders table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o ON a.id = o.account_id;
```

Try pulling `standard_qty`, `gloss_qty`, and `poster_qty` from the orders table, and the `website` and the `primary_poc` from the accounts table.

```sql
SELECT
	standard_qty,
	gloss_qty,
	poster_qty,
	a.website,
	a.primary_poc
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON o.account_id = a.id;
```


## JOIN Questions Part I

Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns. Be sure to include the `primary_poc`, `time` of the event, and the `channel` for each event. Additionally, you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen.

```sql
SELECT
	a.primary_poc,
	we.occurred_at,
	we.channel,
	a.name
FROM
	web_events we
JOIN accounts a ON we.account_id = a.id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart';
```

Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. Your final table should include three columns: the `region name`, the `sales rep name`, and the `account name`. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name,
	sr.name,
	a.name
FROM
	sales_reps sr
JOIN region r ON sr.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a ON sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
ORDER BY a.name;
```

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (`total_amt_usd/total`) for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: `region name`, `account name`, and `unit price`. A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by `(total + 0.01)` to assure not dividing by zero.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name AS reg_name,
	a.name AS acc_name,
	(o.total_amt_usd / (o.total + 0.01)) AS unit_price
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r ON r.id = sr.region_id;
```

Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. This time only for the Midwest region. Your final table should include three columns: the `region name`, the `sales rep name`, and the `account name`. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name AS reg,
	sr.name AS sales_rep,
	a.name AS account
FROM
	sales_reps sr
JOIN region r ON sr.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a ON sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY account;
```

Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a first name starting with S and in the Midwest region. Your final table should include three columns: the `region name`, the `sales rep name`, and the `account name`. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name AS reg,
	sr.name AS sales_rep,
	a.name AS account
FROM
	sales_reps sr
JOIN accounts a ON sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r ON sr.region_id = r.id
WHERE sr.name LIKE 'S%' AND r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY account;
```

Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a last name starting with K and in the Midwest region. Your final table should include three columns: the `region name`, the `sales rep name`, and the `account name`. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name AS reg,
	sr.name AS sales_rep,
	a.name AS account
FROM
	sales_reps sr
JOIN region r ON sr.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a ON sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
WHERE sr.name LIKE '% K%' AND r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY account;
```

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (`total_amt_usd/total`) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100. Your final table should have 3 columns: `region name`, `account name`, and `unit price`. In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding `.01` to the denominator here is helpful `total_amt_usd/(total+0.01)`.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name AS region,
	a.name AS account,
	(o.total_amt_usd / (o.total + 0.01)) AS unit_price,
	o.standard_qty
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
JOIN region r ON sr.region_id = r.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100;
```

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (`total_amt_usd/total`) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100 and the poster order quantity exceeds 50. Your final table should have 3 columns: `region name`, `account name`, and `unit price`. Sort for the smallest unit price first. In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding `.01` to the denominator here is helpful `(total_amt_usd/(total+0.01))`.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name AS region,
	a.name AS account,
	(o.total_amt_usd / (o.total + 0.01)) AS unit_price,
	o.standard_qty,
	o.poster_qty
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
JOIN region r ON sr.region_id = r.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price;
```

What are the different channels used by account id 1001? Your final table should have only 2 columns: `account name` and the `different channels`. You can try `SELECT DISTINCT` to narrow down the results to only the unique values.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
	a.id,
	a.name,
	we.channel
FROM
	accounts a
JOIN web_events we ON a.id = we.account_id
WHERE a.id = 1001;
```

Find all the orders that occurred in 2015. Your final table should have 4 columns: `occurred_at`, `account name`, `order total`, and `order total_amt_usd`.

```sql
SELECT
	o.occurred_at,
	a.name,
	o.total,
	o.total_amt_usd
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.occurred_at BETWEEN '2015-01-01' AND '2016-01-01'
ORDER BY o.occurred_at;
```
