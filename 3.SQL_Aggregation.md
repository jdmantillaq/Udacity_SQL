## SUM/COUNT

Find the total amount of poster_qty paper ordered in the orders table.

```sql
SELECT
	sum(o.poster_qty)
FROM
	orders o;
```

Find the total amount of standard_qty paper ordered in the orders table.

```sql
SELECT
	sum(o.standard_qty)
FROM
	orders o;
```

Find the total dollar amount of sales using the total_amt_usd in the orders table.

```sql
SELECT
	sum(o.total_amt_usd)
FROM
	orders o;
```

Find the total amount spent on standard_amt_usd and gloss_amt_usd paper FOR
each order in the orders table. This should give a dollar amount for EACH
order in the table.

```sql
SELECT
	o.standard_amt_usd + o.gloss_amt_usd std_plus_gloss_usd
FROM
	orders o ;
```

Find the standard_amt_usd per unit of standard_qty paper.
Your solution should use both an aggregation and a mathematical operator.

```sql
SELECT
	SUM(standard_amt_usd)/ SUM(standard_qty) standard_price_per_unit
FROM
	orders o;
```

MIN, MAX, & AVG

When was the earliest order ever placed? You only need to return the date.

```sql
SELECT
	min(o.occurred_at)
FROM
	orders o;
```

Try performing the same query as in question 1 without using an aggregation function.

```sql
SELECT
	o.occurred_at
FROM
	orders o
ORDER BY
	o.occurred_at
LIMIT 1;
```

When did the most recent (latest) web_event occur?

```sql
SELECT
	MAX(o.occurred_at)
FROM
	orders o;
```

Try to perform the result of the previous query without using an aggregation function.

```sql
SELECT
	o.occurred_at
FROM
	orders o
ORDER BY
	o.occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well
as the mean amount of each paper type purchased per order.
Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type FOR
the average number of sales, as well as the average amount.

```sql
SELECT
	AVG(o.standard_qty) stand_avg,
	AVG(o.poster_qty) post_avg,
	AVG(o.gloss_qty) gloss_avg,
	AVG(o.standard_amt_usd) stand_usd_avg,
	AVG(o.poster_amt_usd) post_usd_avg,
	AVG(o.gloss_amt_usd) gloss_usd_avg
FROM
	orders o;
```

Via the video, you might be interested in how to calculate the MEDIAN.
Though this is more advanced than what we have covered so far try finding

- what is the MEDIAN total_usd spent on all orders?

```sql
SELECT
	count(o.total_amt_usd)/ 2
FROM
	orders o;
```

```sql
SELECT
	o.total_amt_usd
FROM
	orders o
ORDER BY
	o.total_amt_usd DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	(
SELECT
			total_amt_usd
		FROM
			orders
		ORDER BY
			total_amt_usd
		LIMIT 3457
	) AS Table1
ORDER BY
	total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

## GROUP BY Part I

Which account (by name) placed the earliest order? Your solution should
have the account name and the date of the order.

```sql
SELECT
	t1.account_id,
	a.name,
	t1.date
FROM
	(
SELECT
			o.account_id account_id,
			min(o.occurred_at) date
		FROM
			orders o
		GROUP BY
			o.account_id
		ORDER BY
			date
		LIMIT 1
	) AS t1
JOIN accounts a ON
	t1.account_id = a.id;
```

Find the total sales in usd for each account. You should include two
columns - the total sales for each company's orders in usd and the company name.

```sql
SELECT
	o.account_id,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total_sales,
	a.name
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY
	o.account_id,
	a.name
ORDER BY
	o.account_id
;
```

Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which
account was associated with this web_event? Your query should return only
three values - the date, channel, and account name

```sql
SELECT
	t1.*,
	a.name
FROM
	(
SELECT
			we.account_id,
			we.channel,
			max(we.occurred_at) occurred_at
		FROM
			web_events we
		GROUP BY
			we.account_id,
			we.channel
		ORDER BY
			occurred_at DESC
		LIMIT 1
	) AS t1
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = t1.account_id;
```

```sql
SELECT
	w.occurred_at,
	w.channel,
	a.name
FROM
	web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON
	w.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY
	w.occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Find the total number of times each type of channel from the web_events was
used. Your final table should have two columns - the channel and the number
of times the channel was used.

```sql
SELECT
	we.channel,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	web_events we
GROUP BY
	we.channel;
```

Who was the primary contact associated with the earliest web_event?

```sql
SELECT
	a.primary_poc
FROM
	web_events we
JOIN accounts a ON
	we.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY
	we.occurred_at
LIMIT 1;
```

What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd.
Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd.
Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.

```sql
SELECT
	o.account_id,
	a.name,
	min(o.total_amt_usd) total
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY
	o.account_id,
	a.name
ORDER BY
	total;
```

Find the number of sales reps in each region. Your final table should
have two columns - the region and the number of sales_reps.
Order from fewest reps to most reps.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name region,
	COUNT(*) total_sr
FROM
	sales_reps sr
JOIN region r ON
	sr.region_id = r.id
GROUP BY
	r.name
ORDER BY
	total_sr;
```

Example

```sql
SELECT
	we.account_id,
	we.channel,
	count(we.id) AS events
FROM
	web_events we
GROUP BY
	we.account_id,
	we.channel
ORDER BY
	1,
	3 DESC;
```

## GROUP BY Part II

For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they
purchased across their orders. Your result should have four COLUMNS

- one for the account name and one for the average quantity purchased
  for each of the paper types for each account.

```sql
SELECT
	a.name,
	avg(o.standard_qty) standard_qty,
	avg(o.poster_qty) poster_qty,
	avg(o.gloss_qty) gloss_qty
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY
	a.name
ORDER BY
	1;
```

For each account, determine the average amount spent per order on EACH
paper type. Your result should have four columns - one for the account
name and one for the average amount spent on each paper type.

```sql
SELECT
	a.name,
	avg(o.standard_amt_usd) standard_amt_usd,
	avg(o.poster_amt_usd) poster_amt_usd,
	avg(o.gloss_amt_usd) gloss_amt_usd
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY
	a.name
ORDER BY
	1;
```

Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the
web_events table for each sales rep. Your final table should have
three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number
of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences
first.

```sql
SELECT
	sr.name,
	we.channel,
	Count(*)
FROM
	web_events we
JOIN accounts a ON
	we.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON
	a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
GROUP BY
	sr.name,
	we.channel
ORDER BY
	1,
	3 DESC;
```

Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the
web_events table for each region. Your final table should have three
columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences.
Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name,
	we.channel,
	Count(*)
FROM
	web_events we
JOIN accounts a ON
	we.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON
	a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
JOIN region r ON
	sr.region_id = r.id
GROUP BY
	r.name,
	we.channel
ORDER BY
	1,
	3 DESC;
```

## DISTINCT

Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with MORE
than one region.

```sql
SELECT
	r.name region,
	a.name account
FROM
	accounts a
JOIN sales_reps sr ON
	a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
JOIN region r ON
	sr.region_id = r.id
ORDER BY
	2;
```

```sql
SELECT
	DISTINCT id,
	name
FROM
	accounts;
```

Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	accounts a;
```

```sql
SELECT
	sr.name sales_rep,
	count(*)
FROM
	accounts a
JOIN sales_reps sr ON
	a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	2 DESC;
```

		GROUP BY
			1
		HAVING
			count(*) > 5
		ORDER BY
			2 DESC
	) AS t1;
```

GROUP BY
	1,
	2,
	3
ORDER BY

LIMIT 10;
```

## DATE Functions

Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year,
ordered from greatest to least. Do you notice any trends in the yearly
sales totals?

```sql
SELECT
	date_part(
		'year',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	sum(o.total_amt_usd)
FROM
	orders o
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	1;
```

```sql
SELECT
	date_part(
		'year',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	count(*)
FROM
	orders o
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	1;
```

```sql
SELECT
	max(o.occurred_at)
FROM
	orders o;
```

Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total
dollars? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

```sql
SELECT
	date_part(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	sum(o.total_amt_usd)
FROM
	orders o
WHERE
	date_part(
		'year',
		o.occurred_at
	) < 2017
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	2 DESC;
```

Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total
number of orders? Are all years evenly represented by the dataset?

```sql
SELECT
	date_part(
		'year',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total,
	count(*) num_orders,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd)/ count(*) price_per_order
FROM
	orders o
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	3 DESC;
```

Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total
number of orders? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

```sql
SELECT
	date_part(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total,
	count(*) num_orders,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd)/ count(*) price_per_order
FROM
	orders o
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	3 DESC;
```

In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper
in terms of dollars?

```sql
SELECT
	a.name account,
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	sum(o.gloss_amt_usd) gloss_usd
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
WHERE
	a.name = 'Walmart'
	 Filters before aggregation
GROUP BY
	1,
	2
ORDER BY
	3 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

```sql
SELECT
	a.name account,
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	sum(o.gloss_amt_usd) gloss_usd
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY
	1,
	2
HAVING
	a.name = 'Walmart'
ORDER BY
	3 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

WHERE filters rows before aggregation, reducing the number
of rows processed in GROUP BY and SUM().
HAVING filters after aggregation, meaning all records are
processed and aggregated before filtering, which is less efficient.
HAVING is meant for filtering after aggregation, usually on
aggregated columns like SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd) > 1000.

# CASE Statements

Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to
find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results
to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields.

```sql
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN standard_qty > 0 THEN o.standard_amt_usd / standard_qty
	END unit_price_std
FROM
	orders o;
```

Write a query to display for each order, the account ID, total amount
of the order, and the level of the order - ‘Large’ or ’Small’ -
depending on if the order is $3000 or more, or smaller than $3000.

```sql
SELECT
	o.account_id,
	o.total_amt_usd,
	CASE
		WHEN o.total_amt_usd >= 3000 THEN 'Large'
		ELSE 'Small'
	END AS LEVEL
FROM
	orders o;
```

Write a query to display the number of orders in each of three categories,
based on the total number of items in each order. The three categories are:
'At Least 2000', 'Between 1000 and 2000' and 'Less than 1000'.

```sql
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN o.total >= 2000 THEN 'At Least 2000'
		WHEN o.total >= 1000
		AND o.total < 2000 THEN 'Between 1000 and 2000'
		ELSE 'Less than 1000'
	END AS LEVEL,
	count(*)
FROM
	orders o
GROUP BY
	1;
```

We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on the
amount associated with their purchases. The top level includes anyone
with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd.
The second level is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest level IS
anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated
with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales
of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending
customers listed first.

```sql
SELECT
	a.name,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt_usd,
	CASE
		WHEN sum(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top level'
		WHEN sum(o.total_amt_usd) >= 100000
		AND sum(o.total_amt_usd) < 200000 THEN 'second level'
		ELSE 'third level'
	END AS LEVEL
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	2 DESC;
```

We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want
to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017.
Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top
spending customers listed first.

```sql
SELECT
	o.account_id,
	a.name,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt_usd,
	CASE
		WHEN sum(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top level'
		WHEN sum(o.total_amt_usd) >= 100000
		AND sum(o.total_amt_usd) < 200000 THEN 'second level'
		ELSE 'third level'
	END AS LEVEL
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
WHERE
	o.occurred_at > '2016-01-01'
GROUP BY
	1,
	2
ORDER BY
	3 DESC;
```

We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps
associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with the sales rep name,
the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending ON
if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top sales people first IN
your final table.

```sql
SELECT
	sr.id,
	sr.name,
	count(o.*) num_orders,
	CASE
		WHEN count(o.*) > 200 THEN 'TOP'
		ELSE 'LOW'
	END
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON
	sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY
	1,
	2
ORDER BY
	3 DESC;
```

The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount
associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these
characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing
sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders
or more than 750000 in total sales.
The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales.
Create a table with the sales rep name,
the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top,
middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based
on dollar amount of sales first in your final table. You might see a few
upset sales people by this criteria!

```sql
SELECT
	sr.id,
	sr.name,
	count(o.*) num_orders,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt_usd,
	CASE
		WHEN count(o.*) > 200
		AND sum(o.total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'Top'
		WHEN count(o.*) > 150
		OR sum(o.total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'Middle'
		ELSE 'Low'
	END
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	a.id = o.account_id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON
	sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY
	1,
	2
ORDER BY
	5 DESC,
	4 DESC;
```

## Subquery

We want to find the average number of events for each day for each channel.
The first table will provide us the number of events for each day and channel,
and then we will need to average these values together using a second query.

````sql
SELECT
	channel,
	round(
		avg(repetitions),
		2
	)
FROM
	(
		```sql
SELECT
			date_trunc(
				'day',
				we.occurred_at
			),
			we.channel channel,
			count(*) repetitions
		FROM
			web_events we
		GROUP BY
			1,
			2
	) t1
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	2 DESC
;
````

On which day-channel pair did the most events occur.

```sql
SELECT
	date_trunc(
		'day',
		we.occurred_at
	),
		we.channel channel,
		count(*) repetitions
FROM
	web_events we
GROUP BY
		1,
		2
ORDER BY
	3 DESC;
```

## More on Subquery

```sql
SELECT
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		we.occurred_at
	)
FROM
	web_events we
ORDER BY
	1
LIMIT 1;
```

````sql
SELECT
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	),
	avg(o.standard_qty) standard_qty,
	avg(o.poster_qty) poster_qty,
	avg(o.gloss_qty) gloss_qty,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total
FROM
	orders o
WHERE
	date_trunc(
		'month',
		o.occurred_at
	) = (
		```sql
SELECT
			date_trunc(
				'month',
				we.occurred_at
			)
		FROM
			web_events we
		ORDER BY
			1
		LIMIT 1
	)
GROUP BY
	1;
````

## Subquery Mania

Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount OF
total_amt_usd sales.
Total usd per sales_rep per region

```sql
SELECT
	r.name region,
	sr.name sales_rep,
	sum(o.total_amt_usd) total_usd
FROM
	orders o
JOIN accounts a ON
	o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps sr ON
	sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r ON
	sr.region_id = r.id
GROUP BY
	1,
	2;
```

Max total USD per region

```sql
SELECT
	t2.region,
	MAX(t2.total_usd)
FROM
	(
SELECT
			r.name region,
			sr.name sales_rep,
			sum(o.total_amt_usd) total_usd
		FROM
			orders o
		JOIN accounts a ON
			o.account_id = a.id
		JOIN sales_reps sr ON
			sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
		JOIN region r ON
			sr.region_id = r.id
		GROUP BY
			1,
			2
	) AS t2
GROUP BY
	1;
```

Now we join the two tables in order to compute the result

```sql
SELECT
	t1.region,
	t1.sales_rep,
	t1.total_usd
